CSS Summary


--- display: block; ---
My understanding of display: block; in css is that any element with that style will take up the entire width of the parent container
unless the width is set. If the width is set to something like w-96 or w-[30%] or w-2/3 it will take up that percentage of the parent container.
However if the content of the element exceeds that size it may overflow into the parent container. Setting the width is just for the border and 
background-color not the content of the element.


--- display: inline; ---
